<h2 class="h3">Two-way data binding</h2>
<hr />
<p>
  Here I have created a basic to do app in order to practise two-way binding.I have done it first in
  the traditional way of using <code>@Input</code> and <code>@Output</code> decorators on the same
  element and secondly, more simply with <code>@ngModel</code>.

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <app-method-one></app-method-one>
  </div>
