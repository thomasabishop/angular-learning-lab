<h4 class="h5">Basic click event</h4>
<p>On button click an alert is displayed in the window.</p>
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" (click)="basicClickEvent()">Click</button>
  </div>

<h4 class="h5">Click counter</h4>
<p>
  A basic click component with increment and decrement functions. The decrement function is limited
  to positive integers. When the 'Invoke service' button is clicked, the current value of the
  counter is presented as an alert. This functionality is provided by an injectable service.

<h3 class="h4">Using <code>$event</code> for one-way event binding</h3>
<p>
  The examples above work by firing a method when a click occurs. Click events are obviously one of
  the built-in events provided by the browser. We are also able to write our own custom events. An
  example is given in the project
  <a routerLink="/component-directionality">Component interaction and data directionality</a> where
  an event tied to a form input bubbles up to its parent container.
</p>
<p>
  One of the constructs we use when we write custom events is <code>$event</code>. This is unique to
  Angular and is a special type of template variable that can be applied to (typically) UI-elements.
  When applied it captures whatever event is associated with the particular element. The example
  below shows this in action on an input element. We create a variable in the class component and
  have this update based on what the user types in the input. This is tied to the
  <code>input</code> event but we could also use <code>onChange</code> or <code>onKeydown</code>.
</p>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>
      <code>{{ inputVariable }}</code>
    </p>
    <form class="mb-2">
      <input type="text" class="form-control" (input)="updateVariable($event)" />
    </form>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  Whatever you type it will be logged because we are capturing the value property of the event
  object with the following line in the template:
</p>
<pre>
    <code [highlight]="printInput"></code>
</pre>

<p>We do this in the component class with the following:</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="printComponent"></code>
</pre>

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  This is an example of <b>one-way data binding</b> where the data is going from child to parent.
  Another example of one-way data binding is provided
  <a routerLink="/component-directionality">here</a>, where we pass data from parent to child.
</div>
